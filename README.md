# README
## Files in this website are for the following article:
> Yu-Dong Cai,Shiqi Zhang,Yu-Hang Zhang,Xiaoyong Pan,KaiYan Feng,Lei Chen,Tao Huang,XiangYin Kong,Identification of the gene expression rules that define the subtypes in glioma, submitted to Journal of Clinical Medicine.
## There are two files in this website. Their descriptions are as follows:
1. [expression_profiles.zip](https://github.com/cloud2010/bio/releases/download/v1.0/expression_profiles.zip): it contains the single-cell expression profiles of glioma tissues on 23686 genes.
2. [optimal_expression_profiles.zip](https://github.com/cloud2010/bio/releases/download/v1.0/optimal_expression_profiles.zip): it contains the single-cell expression profiles of glioma tissues on 539 optimal genes extracted by our study.
